            Hi! I'm the Pillsbury Doughboy. If I were a student at the University of Kansas, I would major in Laughs! I love to talk about my famous crescent rolls, spend time with my dough-family, and make all of my friends around the world giggle with joy! When I grow up into a doughman, I want to change lives, one pie crust at a time. Enjoy the following information about me, I have put so much thought and time into creating this website and making it a happy space! <br>
            Sincerely, <br>
                The Pillsbury Doughboy <br>
        </p>
